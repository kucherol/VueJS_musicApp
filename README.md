https://music-app-cyan.vercel.app/

Welcome to Muxic App, a delightful pet project that I created using Vue.js, transforming it into a feature-packed music hub where users can store, upload, and enjoy their favorite tunes.

Key features of Muxic App include:

- Music Upload & Storage

- Seamless Music Playback

- User Registration & Authentication

- Responsive Design

- Interactive Music Management

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of Vue JS including...

Components
VUEX State Management
Styling
Handling Events
Lists & Keys
Forms
HTTP Requests

This Vue.js project not only reinforces my expertise in the framework but also highlights my proficiency in building robust and user-friendly web applications.
